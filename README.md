# Hangman Rules
* The user tries to solve the secret word by guessing one letter at a time.
* Should the user guess a correct letter, the user gets another chance.
* The game ends when the user solves the problem, or if the user has 7 guesses, whichever comes first.

# User Interface
User is prompted to select single player or multiplayer.
## Game Play
* In this game, the user is shown a set of underscores that correspond with a word they are to guess.

* The user must select letters from the onscreen keyboard as guesses.

* Should the user guess an incorrect letter, the Hangman gets filled in, one body part at a time.

* Each incorrect letter is logged and the amount of guesses remaining goes down by one.

* Text will appear when the user has one more guess remaining.

* If the user guesses all the correct letters, text will appear, informing the user that they have won.

* If the user guessed incorrectly 7 times, a different text will appear, informing the user that they lost the game.

* The user can continue making letter guesses until they figure out the word.
